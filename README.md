# Numerical Computing
The notebooks I worked on during the Numerical Computing course.

They cover the following topics:
1. **Linear systems**: Matrices, norms, LU factorization, Cholesky Factorization.
2. **Singular value decomposition** with applications to **image compression**.
3. **Linear least squares problem** and **polynomial regression**.
4. **Nonlineare equations**: fixed-point iteration and Newton method.
5. **Unconstrained optimization**: gradient descent and backtracking line search.
6. **Image enhancement**: deblurring, denoising, Tikhonov regularization, total variation denoising.
7. **Super resolution** of images.
